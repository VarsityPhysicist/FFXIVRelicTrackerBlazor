# FFXIVRelicTrackerBlazor

This is a re-write of my FFXIV relic tracker application in the Blazor framework.
The blazor framework allows for the coding of webpages frontends in C#

The tracker can be access at https://varsityphysicist.github.io/FFXIVRelicTrackerBlazor/
Progress is saved to individual characters and all user data is saved locally to users' device
Upon opening the tracker, a default character is created to store data, this can be renamed if desired
